What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

Throughout the projects in this course, I tried creating a solution that would help organize the data for ABC Universityâ€™s computer science department. The 
goal was to take a csv file, or a file with the data for all the courses in the computer science department, and load them into a program, organize them into 
an alphanumeric order, and return the course name and prerequisites for a given user-entered course number. In doing this, I found that by using a binary search 
tree to read in, organize, and display the data, I would be able to accurately and efficiently accomplish the goal of the projects. 

 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

To approach this problem, I decided to use a binary search tree. I found that data in binary search trees were already organized by nodes when entered, which
made it an easier structure to use than compared to a vector or hash table. Different data structures have different advantages, which is why it is important 
that you are familiar with each and know when it is appropriate to use each one. For this particular case, I thought binary search trees were the most appropriate 
abstract data structure for several different reasons, including the fact that they are stored in a sorted order, can easily add or remove data, and are considered 
extremely efficient in regard to the time they take to execute operations and the storage they take up to keep the data secure and accessible.

 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

There were several roadblocks I encountered while going through this project. At first, I chose to use a vector. However, as I began coding my project, I very 
soon realized that I felt more comfortable working with binary search trees, in addition to feeling as though a binary search tree was a more efficient and 
appropriate data structure option for the work needed to be done. Therefore, I decided to switch my chosen data structure. Another roadblock I faced was getting
my code to ask the user for the name of the csv file to open and parse the information given in it. I am still having difficulties with this, but I plan on 
continuing to work on it. To try to combat this obstacle, I searched how to load a csv file in a C++ program, as well as how to parse information in a csv file.
I have tried many different patterns, but I will continue working towards this. 

 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

My work on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs in many ways. First, I was introduced to a lot of new C++ code that 
I was not familiar with at the start of this course. In addition, I learned about different abstract data structures, such as vectors, hash tables, linked lists, 
maps, and binary search trees. I learned the strengths of each of them and what scenarios they should be used in. These helped show me ways I can gather and store 
information, and the functions for each of them helped demonstrate the ways I can organize and sort the data. This will be useful in future software design and 
development when I need to gather, store, or sort information in my program. 

 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

The work I have done on this project has helped to evolve the way I will write programs to ensure they are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. One concept 
that I will continue to implement is writing comments to explain what a piece of my code is trying to accomplish. This helps anyone reading my code to understand 
it better, as well as ensure that I, myself, understand what it is doing. In addition, I will continue to use functions to accomplish a certain task. I can then
implement these functions in the main function. This helps keep my code short, maintainable, easily readable, and reusable. I also feel that using abstract data
structures in my code will help keep my code maintainable and adaptable if I know which structure is the most appropriate and efficient to use. Overall, the 
knowledge I learned in this course and throughout working on my projects will be sure to help me improve on my future projects.
